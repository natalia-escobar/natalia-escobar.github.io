                    <h3>I. Problem Identification</h3>
                    <p>While access to digital recipes and cooking tutorials has never been higher, cooking frequency among younger generations is declining. This transitional age group often faces barriers such as time constraints, limited skills, and competing responsibilities that make cooking at home difficult. This shift contributes to increased food waste, greater reliance on disposable packaging, and the underdevelopment of essential life skills. To address these challenges, we employed a design research methodology grounded in interviews, contextual inquiries, participatory cooking sessions, and rapid prototyping. The goal was to explore how a redesigned kitchen essential could be reimagined as a low-barrier, high-impact intervention for circular behavior change.</p>

                    <h4>a. Target User Group</h4>
                    <p>We conducted interviews with our target user group to validate the pains points we had identified in our research. This validated that the common frustration amongst all surveyed participants was the time spent preparing to cook (gathering ingredients, identifying a recipe, preparing the food, and cleaning up afterwards) as well as their lack of confidence in the kitchen (about 70% of participants self-ranked themselves as 4-7 in cooking ability of a scale from 1-10) that would steer them away from cooking at home. Participants all expressed a desire to improve their own efficiency and reach a point where they would be able to cook confidently and instinctively. </p>
