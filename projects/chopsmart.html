                    <p>Targeting the incoming age of young adults in an effort to build confidence in the kitchen and minimize food waste, ChopSmart is a smart modular cutting board that tackles these challenges by including an AI component that gives the users audio and visual feedback in real-time, guiding them through the cooking process and allowing them to adjust recipes according to the ingredients they have available.</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>I. Problem Identification</h3>
                    <p>While access to digital recipes and cooking tutorials has never been higher, cooking frequency among younger generations is declining. This transitional age group often faces barriers such as time constraints, limited skills, and competing responsibilities that make cooking at home difficult. This shift contributes to increased food waste, greater reliance on disposable packaging, and the underdevelopment of essential life skills. To address these challenges, we employed a design research methodology grounded in interviews, contextual inquiries, participatory cooking sessions, and rapid prototyping. The goal was to explore how a redesigned kitchen essential could be reimagined as a low-barrier, high-impact intervention for circular behavior change.</p>
                    <h3>II. Interviews</h3>
                    <h4>a. Target User Group</h4>
                    <p>We conducted interviews with our target user group to validate the pains points we had identified in our research. This validated that the common frustration amongst all surveyed participants was the time spent preparing to cook (gathering ingredients, identifying a recipe, preparing the food, and cleaning up afterwards) as well as their lack of confidence in the kitchen (about 70% of participants self-ranked themselves as 4-7 in cooking ability of a scale from 1-10) that would steer them away from cooking at home. Participants all expressed a desire to improve their own efficiency and reach a point where they would be able to cook confidently and instinctively. </p>
                    <h4>b. Culinary Students</h4>
                    <p>In contrast to our target user groups, we wanted to understand cooking from an “expert” perspective, so we interviewed culinary students at Johnson & Wales University. The culinary students emphasized that what was pivotal to building confidence in the kitchen was frequent practice and repetition, instead of the tools themselves. They felt that the high-level tools they used were nice to have but did not play an important role in improving their own abilities. </p>
                    <h4>c. Flavor Experts</h4>
                    <p>To also grant a different perspective and inspired from our target user group’s desire to cook instinctively, we also spoke to an expert that specialized in flavor science. Similarly to our interviews with culinary students, this interviewee emphasized that practice and reptition was the key to building a foundation in flavor that can develop into intuitive cooking. </p>
                    
                    <h3>III. Culinary Exercise</h3>
                    <p>As members of our target user group, Elmer and I set out to cook an unfamiliar dish together. The experience revealed several key insights:
                        We spent most of our time toggling between text and video instructions, which disrupted the flow and felt frustrating.
                        Missing ingredients at our local grocery store left us unsure how to substitute effectively.
                        Cooking together made the process more playful; we felt more confident experimenting than we would have alone.</p>

                <div id="prototyping" class="fade-in"> <!-- class="project-card fade-in" -->
                    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                    <h3>I. Initial Concept</h3>
                    <p>Our early research highlighted this user group &apos s need and that digital solutions such as YouTube, phone, tablet are difficult cooking aids that do not provide real-time help or feedback, discouraging people who are inexperienced with cooking. Thus, we decided that we reinvented a tool that reduces barriers to entry of personal food production by emphasizing adaptability and minimizing the digital devices used during the cooking process. We felt that cooking tools needs to be adaptable and provide a seamless cooking experience.</p>
