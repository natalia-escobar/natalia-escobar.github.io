        <h2 class="section-title">Ideating</h2>
        <p>
            My partner and I explored various topics before deciding to venture further into the world of cooking. However, we realized that cooking at home was a pain point for both of us, particularly as we navigated living on our own for the first time. Both of us had not learned how to cook from our parents and were relying on different digital resources and our own limited knowledge as we prepared meals at home. As we explored this idea, we interviewed other users in our target demographic and realized this was a larger shared experience than we had realized. The main insights from the users interviewed were that they felt that preparing a meal was too time-consuming and felt unintuitive to those who perceived they had lower cooking abilities.

        <p>
            To better understand how to bridge the gap between our target demographic and cooking experts, we interviewed culinary students and flavor specialists. Despite having differing areas of expertise, we learned that the experts agreed that the key to improving cooking skills is through repeated practice of different techniques/recipes
