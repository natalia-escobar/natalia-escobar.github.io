                <strong>Design Challenge:</strong> As I gained a deeper understanding for the craftsmanship behind a shoe, I also noticed that the priority in making a shoe was longevity, whether that be in the material of the shoe or the adhesives holding it together. With a sustainability perspective in mind, I wanted to challenge myself to create a shoe entirely out of bio-fabricated materials.

                Shoes have always felt like a piece of my identity on display. I wanted to connect the shoes with a piece of my heritage. My family is from Barranquilla, Colombia, in which the second-largest Carnaval in the world is hosted. I had always been mesmerised by the traditional dress worn, La Pullera Colorada, when women would dance La Cumbia. I wanted to see how I could translate the gorgeous rippling effect these dresses created in a shoe. While exploring different possibilities, I loved the folds of the classic Puma Satori and used that as inspiration for my design.

                I knew that timing was going to be my biggest constraint going into my project. I consulted with a BioMaterials Scientist at the RISD Nature Lab to discuss what material might be the best fit for the needs of my project and that I would be able to make at home. After our discussion, I decided to create Kombucha SCOBY Leather as the basis for my shoeâ€™s upper, and BioFoam for the sole.

                I estimated that at the earliest, my Kombucha SCOBY Leather would be ready in about 2-4 weeks.

                With the spare SCOBY, I experimented with post-dying it with natural dyes to see how the material behaved.

            <p>
                After two weeks, I checked on my kombucha batch and discovered that it had grown mold. This meant that I had to redo the batch, with even less time as in my initial time frame.
